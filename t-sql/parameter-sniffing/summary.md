# Summary

Index Tuning: Reduce residual predicate and sorts

Query Hints: Take choices away from SQL Server

Recompile: For queries running <1 time per minute, always at the statement level and never the proc level as otherwise you lose visibility to the proc

Branching/Dynamic SQL: Postpones compilation until SQL Server knows more about the data
