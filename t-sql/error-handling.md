# ‚ùå Error Handling

## Stored Procedures

TRY..CATCH only catches medium level SQL errors!

* This does not include failovers, system outages, etc
* Even if you use BEGIN TRAN and COMMIT TRAN, the transaction will remain open if the user closes the query mid-transaction and will result in a "Zombie" Thread
  * Always use ROLLBACK in your CATCH block
* What if we use BEGIN TRAN..COMMIT TRAN wrapped in BEGIN TRY..BEGIN CATCH?
  * Same problem as before.. no rollback and transaction remains open
