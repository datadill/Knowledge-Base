# DF300

## Stage Expressions

### $project

* Good for creating brand new fields or renaming fields
* Only sends new fields you specify from one stage to the next

### $set

* $set is very similar to project, but the major difference is that $set will forward ALL of the fields of the document as well as the ones you $set
* From a performance perspective, the instructor said that $project is not necessarily faster than $set even though you are likely returning less fields in $project
