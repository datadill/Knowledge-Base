# Discovery Call

Before the call

* Do background research on the company and check out the existing website



Step 1

* Ask the client what they hope a new website will do for their company
  * Does the client want more leads?
  * More sales?
* Never make an assumption
* Ask them what the goal is and you should **advise them** on how to achieve that goal
* Most people don't fully understand the power of a website and simply view a website as a brochure
  * Help them think bigger
* One of the goals is to be seen as a trusted advisor
  * Once the website is done, they will no longer have a use for you
* Flags to look out for...
  * Somebody who thinks they are an expert



Step 2

* Probe for more details and be specific
* Lets say the client says "I just want more leads"
  * You might want to respond with "How many leads would you like the website to bring in every week? month?"
    * This gives you a good idea of how easy/hard it will be, give you an opening to talk numbers, let's you know how realistic their expectations are
    * If they say they want 50 leads a month you can ask how many leads does it typically take to close a sale along with the average price of sale when someone buys
    * Tip: acknowledge the fact that leads don't pay the bills!
* If the website you build helps them generate $50k per month, factor that in
* "50 leads is a makable target, for sure. Do you already have a plan for how you're going to drive the traffic needed to hit that goal or is that something you would like help with?"
  * Upsell!



Step 3

* Qualify them by throwing out a budget range and see if they flinch
* The sooner you talk price the better!
* "We can design a website and digital marketing plan that get your company 50 leads a month, which sounds like it would generate 50k/month, I am confident about that.. my question is about budget..."
  * If it sounds like they have a low budget, you must NOT go below your minimum
* "our minimum is $5000 to build a new website, does that feel low or high to you?
  * Never ask a client for their budget
  * If they have an established business with money, go with the "price bracketing" approach of throwing out a range
    * "the last few sites we did that are similar to what you're wanting were between $10,000 and $20,000. Is that within the range you were thinking?"
    * The range needs to coincide with the scope of the website they're wanting based on prior research
* Keep in mind that you are selling a phase one website to build a good rapport and eventually start doing their marketing
* Once they have established they are okay with the range, your goal is to get a more accurate understanding
  * Ex. lets say the range was 10-20k.. "Perfect. Will we have the full $20,000 to work with or do we need to be on the lower end of that range?"
    * This lets them know that if they are on the lower end of the range then we won't be able to commit as much time, but it is asked in a non-threatening way

Step 4

* Get clear on features and functionality
* Find the technical pieces to their website as those take a lot of time
* If you notice things on their current site is missing, sell them on it!
* Pull up their site on a tool like AHREFs and show them their current SEO status vs their competitors
* If you notice issues with copy, conversion, optimization, UX, etc point those out and talk about how we would fix those issues
