# Tips

* Good to put a call to action in both header and footer
* When creating a header in Bricks, it is okay to use a section, but make sure to switch it to a div
* If you want to move a div all the way right, add margin left **auto**
* If you are working on a header or footer and you want to load in your home page you can go into templates -> template settings -> populate content and load the page
* You can size logos with width rem
