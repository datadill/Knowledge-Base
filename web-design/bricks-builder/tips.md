# Tips

* Good to put a call to action in both header and footer
* When creating a header in Bricks, it is okay to use a section, but make sure to switch it to a div
* If you want to move a div all the way right, add margin left **auto**
* If you are working on a header or footer and you want to load in your home page you can go into templates -> template settings -> populate content and load the page
* You can size logos with width rem
* 60-30-10 color guideline
  * 60% - neutral ex. white, black, grey, etc)
  * 30% - primary
  * 10% - call to Action
* Base color should not be pure black, but instead a slightly less dark shade such as #222222
* If you are trying to round a video, put it into a container and then apply radius to the corners. You must then remove the overflow to cut off the edges.
