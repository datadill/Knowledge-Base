# Utility vs Custom Classes

Utility classes are good for something like a button that never changes

Never write a heading in all capital letters

* Instead, use CSS

For contextual background image in bricks...

* Give a .hero class to your section
* Give a hero\_\_image class to your image
* Assign your hero class as relative
* Assign your image class as absolute
* Under positioning, make them all 0 so the image stretches
* set the image to cover so it is not stretched

Every element should have a class

Make all your classes first and then do your styling

When working with icons of different sizes they may be different sizes so you should put a static REM value on the **height** and not the width
