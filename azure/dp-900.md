File Formats

* _Avro_ is a row-based format. Avro is a good format for compressing data and minimizing storage and network bandwidth requirements.
* _ORC_ (Optimized Row Columnar format) organizes data into columns rather than rows. It was developed by HortonWorks for optimizing read and write operations in Apache Hive (Hive is a data warehouse system that supports fast data summarization and querying over large datasets).
* _Parquet_ is another columnar data format. A Parquet file contains row groups. Data for each column is stored together in the same row group. Each row group contains one or more chunks of data. A Parquet file includes metadata that describes the set of rows found in each chunk. Parquet specializes in storing and processing nested data types efficiently.



Four common types of Non-relational database

* Key:Value
* Document databases
  * which are a specific form of key-value database in which the value is a JSON document (which the system is optimized to parse and query)
* Column family databases
  * which store tabular data comprising rows and columns, but you can divide the columns into groups known as column-families. Each column family holds a set of columns that are logically related together.
* Graph databases
  * which store entities as nodes with links to define relationships between them.



ACID

* Atomicity
  * each transaction is treated as a single unit, which succeeds completely or fails completely.
* Consistency
  * transactions can only take the data in the database from one valid state to another.
* Isolation
  * concurrent transactions cannot interfere with one another, and must result in a consistent database state.
* Durability&#x20;
  * when a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed.



* **Azure SQL Database** – a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) database hosted in Azure
* **Azure SQL Managed Instance** – a hosted instance of SQL Server with automated maintenance, which allows more flexible configuration than Azure SQL DB but with more administrative responsibility for the owner.
* **Azure SQL VM** – a virtual machine with an installation of SQL Server, allowing maximum configurability with full management responsibility.
* **Azure Cosmos DB** is a global-scale non-relational (_NoSQL_) database system that supports multiple application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling you to store and manage data as JSON documents, key-value pairs, column-families, and graphs.
* **Azure SQL Edge** - A SQL engine that is optimized for Internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios that need to work with streaming time-series data.



Azure Storage

* **Blob containers** - scalable, cost-effective storage for binary files.
* **File shares** - network file shares such as you typically find in corporate networks.
* **Tables** - key-value storage for applications that need to read and write data values quickly.
* Data engineers use Azure Storage to host _data lakes_ - blob storage with a hierarchical namespace that enables files to be organized in folders in a distributed file system.



**Azure Synapse Analytics** is a comprehensive, unified data analytics solution that provides a single service interface for multiple analytical capabilities, including:

* **Pipelines** - based on the same technology as Azure Data Factory.
* **SQL** - a highly scalable SQL database engine, optimized for data warehouse workloads.
* **Apache Spark** - an open-source distributed data processing system that supports multiple programming languages and APIs, including Java, Scala, Python, and SQL.
* **Azure Synapse Data Explorer** - a high-performance data analytics solution that is optimized for real-time querying of log and telemetry data using Kusto Query Language (KQL).

A**zure Databricks** is an Azure-integrated version of the popular Databricks platform, which combines the Apache Spark data processing platform with SQL database semantics and an integrated management interface to enable large-scale data analytics.



**Azure HDInsight** is an Azure service that provides Azure-hosted clusters for popular Apache open-source big data processing technologies, including:

* **Apache Spark** - a distributed data processing system that supports multiple programming languages and APIs, including Java, Scala, Python, and SQL.
* **Apache Hadoop** - a distributed system that uses _MapReduce_ jobs to process large volumes of data efficiently across multiple cluster nodes. MapReduce jobs can be written in Java or abstracted by interfaces such as Apache Hive - a SQL-based API that runs on Hadoop.
* **Apache HBase** - an open-source system for large-scale NoSQL data storage and querying.
* **Apache Kafka** - a message broker for data stream processing.



**Azure Stream Analytics** is a real-time stream processing engine that captures a stream of data from an input, applies a query to extract and manipulate data from the input stream, and writes the results to an output for analysis or further processing.



**Microsoft Purview** provides a solution for enterprise-wide data governance and discoverability. You can use Microsoft Purview to create a map of your data and track data lineage across multiple data sources and systems, enabling you to find trustworthy data for analysis and reporting.
