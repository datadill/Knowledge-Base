# Describe the Concept of Zero Trust

1\) Verify Explicitly&#x20;

* For every interaction, re-authenticate and verify the access
* Look for any anomalies in that interaction

2\) Least Privileges

* Only grant the permissions absolutely necessary

3\) Assume Breach

* Assume bad actors on the network at all times
