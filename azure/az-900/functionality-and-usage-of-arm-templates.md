# Functionality and Usage of ARM Templates

ARM Template

* Declarative in nature meaning that you describe the end state
* Idempotent&#x20;
* Not the most friendly of formats for a non-dev
* Makes it very easy to change settings after deploying
* Deploy in parallel (if possible)
* Source control the ARM files
* Terraform is 3rd party, but can be used as well
