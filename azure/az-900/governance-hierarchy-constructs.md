# Governance Hierarchy Constructs

Policy

* Ability to create those guardrails that can block, audit, or remediate
* Rules -> actions that are assigned at a scope such an RG, resource, or subscription
* Inherited downwards

RBAC

* Role assignment
  * A security principal from AAD gets assigned a certain role

Budget

* Set a $ amount and a threshold&#x20;
  * Could be % of budget or based on a forecast to predict what spend will be



The above 3 constructs can be used to govern your environment
