# Benefits and Usage of IoT Services

Internet of Things is an ongoing communication between on-prem devices and the cloud&#x20;



IoT Hub

* A hub where IoT devices can communicate to&#x20;
* Device to cloud telemetry
* Device to cloud upload
* Cloud to device

Device Twin

* In the IoT hub, you can write an app that communicates with the device twin in Azure
  * When the physical device checks in with the IoT hub, it will perform that action
  * IoT hub is responsible for the underlying plumbing AKA SDKs

IoT Central

* Uses IoT Hub
* IoT Central can be considered SaaS whereas IoT hub is more PaaS
* Right out of the box it provides dashboards and device templates for common industry scenarios
* Ability to simulate devices for testing
* Create rules via a wizard

Azure Sphere

* Provides end to end security
* Microsoft licenses the software for manufacturers to install Azure Sphere on a micro controller unit (IoT device)
