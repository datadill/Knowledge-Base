# Functionality and Usage of Microsoft Sentinel

SIEM - Security Information Event Management

* Helps find various threats or exposures

SOAR - Security Orchestration Automation Response

* Automatically respond to events

Microsoft Sentinel takes care of the above two bullet points

* Sits on top of a Log Analytics Workspace
  * It sits on top of this because all of the information is already flowing through here typically
* Looks at all the logs and signals and adds intelligence on top to give you meaningful insight
