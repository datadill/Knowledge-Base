# Azure Blueprints

Just as a blueprint allows an engineer or an architect to sketch a project's design parameters, Azure Blueprints enables cloud architects and central information technology groups to define a repeatable set of Azure resources that implements and adheres to an organization's standards, patterns, and requirements. Azure Blueprints makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and start up new environments with trust they're building within organizational compliance with a set of built-in components, such as networking, to speed up development and delivery.

Blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as:

* Role Assignments
* Policy Assignments
* Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates)
* Resource Groups
