# Identify The Right Service Type

Whenever possible, try to look for a SaaS offering&#x20;

* If you need email, collaboration, etc.. then go with Microsoft 365

Want to move domain controllers or file servers?

* It probably won't be in an app service or container so you would go to a VM offering, which would be IaaS

Have a web service like IIS on windows?

* Web based is usually app service, which would be PaaS

Want to graphically design a flow model or series of steps?

* Logic apps is a no-brainer
