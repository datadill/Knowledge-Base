# CapEx, OpEx and Consumption-based

Capital Expenditure - Pre-purchasing a particular asset that you plan to use for a certain period of time

* Depreciate this over a period of time

Operational Expenditure - Purchasing a resource as we use it (Cloud) AKA consumption based

* Allows a company to only pay for what they need whether it be hardware or licensing
* As the company grows, you can easily pay for more resources to continue that growth
* Ex. A pizza company might be really busy on Friday nights, but not so busy on other days
