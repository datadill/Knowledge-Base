# Azure ARC

Azure provides us the capacity to spin up resources/services along with management software (tagging, firewalls, defender, RBAC, etc)

Azure Arc extends the control plane of Azure ARM to on-premise or other clouds via agents that are installed on the OS

* You can deploy governance, defender for cloud, patching, automation, tagging, etc
* Extend azure resources to resources outside of Azure
