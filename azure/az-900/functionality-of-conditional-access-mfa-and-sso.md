# Functionality of Conditional Access, MFA and SSO

Conditional Access

* Enforced through policies&#x20;
* You can target all applications, a particular application, a certain user, etc
  * They need to follow conditions to be granted access
    * ex. Are they using MFA or are they on a proper device

MFA&#x20;

* Available on AAD P1+ subscriptions
  * You might have the authenticator app, sms, call, token, etc
* Security defaults (without p1 or higher) you only get MFA like the auth app



SSO (Single or seamless sign on)

* Authenticate to Azure AD, which then grants you tokens that can be used elsewhere creating a seamless experience for the user
