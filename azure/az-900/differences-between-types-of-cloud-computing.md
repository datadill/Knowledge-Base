# Differences Between Types of Cloud Computing

Pooling Resources is what makes the cloud work so well

* We want to avoid islands of resources because that wastes any additional capacity that might be required for a customer

Self-service

* Self-service gives people more responsibility to spin up resources themselves on-demand
  * You can setup quotas and policies to manage this

Public Cloud (OpEx)

* Azure, AWS, etc
* Limitless&#x20;
  * Many regions, many services, etc

Private Cloud (CapEx)

* Management software that helps users create resources
* Fixed number of resources, but you have the flexibility to provision what a business user might request so as long as it is confined within the available resources

Hybrid Cloud

* Using both the private and public cloud often seamlessly
* You might be offering a service on-prem, but during peak times it runs off of Azure
* Azure Stack and Azure Arc can bring Azure type services to the private cloud&#x20;
  * You might have IoT with Machine Learning models that need to quickly react so this would be a good use case for keeping it on-prem while still utilizing Azure type services
