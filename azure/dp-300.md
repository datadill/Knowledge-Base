Azure SQL VM

* Great for compatibility&#x20;
* Great for individuals installing SSIS/SSRS/SSAS or other 3rd party software directly on the SQL Server
* Backup functionality
  * Back up to URL
    * Standard backup syntax that goes directly to Azure Blob Storage
  * Azure Backup
    * Enterprise backup solution that automatically handles your backups



VM Storage

* Standard
* Standard SSD
* Premium SSD
* Ultra Disk
* For prod tLogs, you should only ever use Premium SSD or Ultra disk
  * premium == 5-10ms latency
  * ultra == 1-2ms latency
* Stanard usually suffices for backups



Microsoft guarantees uptime of at least 99.9% for single instance Azure virtual machine, when using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all disks.



Azure SQL Database

* vCore vs DTU
  * vCore decouples compute and storage
    * General Purpose, Business Critical, Hyperscale
      * Business critical includes a read-only replica and more memory per core/ssd storage
      * Hyperscale lets you scale storage and compute resources well over the scale of the other 2 tiers
  * DTU
    * Basic, Standard, Premium
      * Couples together storage, CPU, etc
    * Scaling may incur a brief connection interruption at the end of the operation
      * This can be somewhat mitigated by apps performing proper retry logic
      * 2 scenarios cause a blip
        * Initiation of a scaling operation
        * adding a DB to an elastic pool
    * Azure SQL Managed Instance doesn't support DTU-based purchasing model

Serverless Compute Tier

* despite name, does require a server with database
  * it is best thought of as an autoscale/pause solution for Azure SQL DB
    * auto-pause allows you to define period of inactivity before pausing DB
    * auto-start will cause the DB to spin back up when it is used
      * during this time, only storage costs are incurred&#x20;

Deployment Models

* Single vs Elastic
  * Elastic shares resources
  * Single has its' own set of resources even if the same underlying logical server is used
  * Elastic is great for multi-tenant DBs where each tenant avg CPU is low

Networking

* Azure SQL DB by default has a public internet endpoint, which can be controlled via firewall rules or limited to specific azure netowrks, using freatures like Virtual Netowrk endpoints or Private Link

Backups

* With SQL Database, you can increase administration efficiency by knowing that databases are backed up regularly, and that they are continuously copied to a read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS).
* Full backups are performed every week, differential backups every 12 to 24 hours, and transaction log backups every 5 to 10 minutes.
