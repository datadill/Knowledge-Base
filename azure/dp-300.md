Azure SQL VM

* Great for compatibility&#x20;
* Great for individuals installing SSIS/SSRS/SSAS or other 3rd party software directly on the SQL Server
* Backup functionality
  * Back up to URL
    * Standard backup syntax that goes directly to Azure Blob Storage
  * Azure Backup
    * Enterprise backup solution that automatically handles your backups



VM Storage

* Standard
* Standard SSD
* Premium SSD
* Ultra Disk
* For prod tLogs, you should only ever use Premium SSD or Ultra disk
  * premium == 5-10ms latency
  * ultra == 1-2ms latency
* Stanard usually suffices for backups



Microsoft guarantees uptime of at least 99.9% for single instance Azure virtual machine, when using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all disks.



Azure SQL Database

* vCore vs DTU
  * vCore decouples compute and storage
    * General Purpose, Business Critical, Hyperscale
      * Business critical includes a read-only replica and more memory per core/ssd storage
      * Hyperscale lets you scale storage and compute resources well over the scale of the other 2 tiers
  * DTU
    * Basic, Standard, Premium
      * Couples together storage, CPU, etc
    * Scaling may incur a brief connection interruption at the end of the operation
      * This can be somewhat mitigated by apps performing proper retry logic
      * 2 scenarios cause a blip
        * Initiation of a scaling operation
        * adding a DB to an elastic pool
    * Azure SQL Managed Instance doesn't support DTU-based purchasing model
