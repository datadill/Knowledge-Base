Capital Expenditure vs Operational Expenditure

* on-prem you pay for everything upfront, but in the cloud you pay for capacity based on what you use

IaaS = Full access to OS, but removes networking, compute, storage, etc

PaaS = Unlike IaaS, with PaaS you are only responsible for your app and data

SaaS = Everything is provided



Regions

* Each region (e.g. east-us, west-us) will have multiple physical buildings that are relatively close together, but have separate cooling/networking/power/etc (Availability Zone)
  * For each subscription, you will have 3 availability zones, but if you have a second subscription then you might have 3 different availability zones (AKA 3 different buildings within the same region)
  * Zone redundant means that the service spans the availability zones. Some services are done automatically for you with a simple checkbox while other services have to be pinned to each individual zones manually (e.g. a VM has to be created and applied to each AZ manually)
* Close to customers, regulatory reasons, disaster recovery from natural disasters are all reasons for having multiple regions

Azure AD

* Cloud IDP (Identity Provider) contains users, groups, devices, applications, etc
* OIDC, SAML, WSFED, OAUTH2
* Authentication (OIDC, SAML, WSFED or **MFA** which involves any **2** of the previous) means proving who I am via something I know like a password/pin or something I have like a token/cellphone or something I am like a biometric
* Authorization (RBAC: Role based access control) is what scope of permissions you fall into once authenticated. This involves a certain level of permissions at a particular scope (owner, reader, contributor, etc)
  * Policies are guardrails assigning what a user is allowed to do, but can also be used for auditing purposes
* A lot of companies will already have an on-prem AD, which can be synced to azure with AAD Connect, which then enables SSO (seamless sign-on) allowing the user to seamlessly access Azure resources once connected on-prem
* Management Groups can be used to further control access
  * RBAC, Policy, and budget can be applied to each management group
* A subscription is essentially a billing boundary
  * Once again, RBAC, Policy and budget can be applied to a subscription, which can filter down to management groups
* Resources get created in a resource group, which is nested inside a subscription (note: RGs can **not** be nested)&#x20;
  * Once again, RBAC, Policy and budget can be applied to a resource group
  * Resource groups do not limit connectivity
