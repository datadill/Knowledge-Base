Capital Expenditure vs Operational Expenditure

* on-prem you pay for everything upfront, but in the cloud you pay for capacity based on what you use

IaaS = Full access to OS, but removes networking, compute, storage, etc

PaaS = Unlike IaaS, with PaaS you are only responsible for your app and data

SaaS = Everything is provided



Regions

* Each region (e.g. east-us, west-us) will have multiple physical buildings that are relatively close together, but have separate cooling/networking/power/etc (Availability Zone)
  * For each subscription, you will have 3 availability zones, but if you have a second subscription then you might have 3 different availability zones (AKA 3 different buildings within the same region)
  * Zone redundant means that the service spans the availability zones. Some services are done automatically for you with a simple checkbox while other services have to be pinned to each individual zones manually (e.g. a VM has to be created and applied to each AZ manually)
* Close to customers, regulatory reasons, disaster recovery from natural disasters are all reasons for having multiple regions
* Availability Set is when your resources are on different racks within the same AZ

Azure AD

* Cloud IDP (Identity Provider) contains users, groups, devices, applications, etc
* OIDC, SAML, WSFED, OAUTH2
* Authentication (OIDC, SAML, WSFED or **MFA** which involves any **2** of the previous) means proving who I am via something I know like a password/pin or something I have like a token/cellphone or something I am like a biometric
* Authorization (RBAC: Role based access control) is what scope of permissions you fall into once authenticated. This involves a certain level of permissions at a particular scope (owner, reader, contributor, etc)
  * Policies are guardrails assigning what a user is allowed to do, but can also be used for auditing purposes
* A lot of companies will already have an on-prem AD, which can be synced to azure with AAD Connect, which then enables SSO (seamless sign-on) allowing the user to seamlessly access Azure resources once connected on-prem
* Management Groups can be used to further control access
  * RBAC, Policy, and budget can be applied to each management group, which can filter down to a subscription
* A subscription is essentially a billing boundary
  * Once again, RBAC, Policy and budget can be applied to a subscription
* Resources get created in a resource group, which is nested inside a subscription (note: RGs can **not** be nested)&#x20;
  * Once again, RBAC, Policy and budget can be applied to a resource group
  * Resource groups do not limit connectivity
  * RGs should have a common lifecycle so that everything is created and destroyed as a group
* Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
  * Used to simplify the provisioning of resources. The portal, mobile app, AZ CLI, and PoshAZ module all use ARM
    * John Savill says that the portal is good for looking at what's available, but for provisioning actual resources it should be avoided because it is subject to change
    * ARM JSON templates are declarative/idempotent where you declare the end state and make provisioning significantly easier
      * Terraform is a 3rd party product that allows you to more easily create ARM templates
  * Resource Locks can prevent a user from deleting a resource
  * Tags can be applied in a key:value format, which is essentially just metadata
    * Tags do NOT get inherited
  * Blueprint
    * Comprised of artifcats (policies, ARM template, RGs, and roles) allow for reusability and consistency&#x20;

Resources

* VMs have memory, vcpus, network, IOps
  * SKUs are like pre-packaged VMs that are setup with similar ratios
    * "Memory optimized" or "general purpose"
  * VM Scale Set
    * Pick a certain template for the disk, a certain configuration, and assign the auto scale values, which creates and deletes VMs behind-the-scenes based on what you set
  * Azure Dedicated Host
    * By default, the cloud is multi-tenant, but you can pay Microsoft for a dedicated host of a particular SKU that you can then use to create multiple VMs of the same SKU type, but they can also be different in size
  * Azure Batch will allow you to do large scale executions where it will provision the necessary resources for a specific job
  * Container Host
    * The VM already exists, but there are multiple sandboxes under the same OS
    * Allows the user to quickly run containers against a specific sandbox that will spin up much faster than an entire VM since the VM already exists
    * These are multi-tenant, but there is still isolation from your neighbor despite being on the same VM
  * Azure Container Instance
    * Runs on it's own instance separated from other tenants
    * there are VNETs and public endpoints
  * Azure Kubernetes Service
    * This will spin up a node pool, which utilizes VM scale sets
  * Azure App Service
    * Webapp service, API, mobile
* All of the above are PaaS, but there are still underlying VMs
  * Serverless.. you pay for the work it actually does
    * Event-driven
    * Azure Functions
      * Running code from various languages
    * Azure Logic Apps
      * No or low code
* Azure Virtual Desktop
  * self-explanatory&#x20;

Azure Key Vault

* Secrets, keys, and certs
* RBAC can control on an individual secret level
  * You can give the identity of an app service access to a specific secret, which then provides access to something else
    * i.e. an app service can only ever be itself and nobody can imitate that app service&#x20;

Networking

* With a subscription, you can use multiple regions, but a vnet exists within a certain region/subscription.. it cannot span multiple
* Under this a vnet is created and is defined at minimum by 1:m ipv4 address ranges
  * RFC 1918 or 192.168.16 will never be routed over the internet
* When picking an ip range, you need to make sure it doesn't conflict with anything else you might have such as on-prem network
  * You can optionally add ipv6 ranges on top of ipv4
* Within the vnet, you can create virtual subnets which also have an ip range
  * A subnet can span all the availability zones within a region
* site-to-site vpn is encrypted over the internet
  * policy allows for 1 connection and is considered legacy
  * route-based allows for n number of connections as well as point to site which means you can setup connection to a single machineExpress Route gateway&#x20;
* Express Route
  * not over the internet
  * private peering
* Network Security Group
  * built around a series of properties
    * Protocol, src/dest port, src/dest IP, name/desc, allow/deny, Service Tags, Application Security Group (e.g. if this NIC is applied with the tag "SQL" then apply these rules)
    * These are then linked to subnets
* Azure Firewall
  * A storage account might have its' own firewall
  * you might have a vnet with a subnet and you want to be able to connect to that storage account
  * you might create a service endpoint and then configure the firewall to allow that subnet service to connect
  * If you have a second storage account that you want to be able to use from other networks.. you might have a private endpoint, which is an ip address in the subnet that is given permissions to communicate with the storage account
  * Basic and standard DDoS protection
    * You can create a standard plan and then link it to multiple VNETs
    * The basic plan is free&#x20;

Storage Account

* Lives in a region and has a certain redundancy
* Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) - Spread across a single AZ in a single region
* Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS) - Spread across 3 AZs in a single region
* Geo Redundant Storage (GRS) - Spread across a single AZ in multiple regions
  * Paired asynchronously to remote region
* Geo Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS) - Spread across 3 AZs in primary region and paired region
  * Paired asynchronously to remote region
* Blob
  * Block - stored in containers and they are flat (no true folders or directory)
    * You can ADLS gen 2 on top
  * Page - good for read/write
    * Disks
      * STD HDD
      * STD SSD
      * Premium SSD - requires "s" version of VM
      * Ultra Disk - requires "s" version of VM
  * Append - good for logging
* Files
  * SMB or NFS Shares
  * Azure File Sync would allow you to sync on-prem file servers to that cloud share
* Tables
  * Key:Value schemaless storage
* Queue
  * FIFO
* Hot/Cool/Archive (offline) storage
  * Lifecycle management helps move data between storage levels and or delete it

Databases

* Azure SQL Database (PaaS)
  * Hyperscale, Serverless, Regular, Standard, Business Critical
* Azure SQL Managed Instance (MI)
  * Compatibility&#x20;
* Postgresql
* mySQL
* CosmosDB
  * Multiple models&#x20;
    * Cassandra, graph, etc
    * Typically you have a single read/write and multiple read replicas, but with CosmosDB you get to pick the consistency&#x20;
      * Strong, bounded staleness, session, etc
* IoT
  * Azure IoT Hub
    * Register devices known to this service
    * Exposes SDKs that can then be used in your apps to get information
  * Azure IoT Central
    * Sits on top of Hub, but adds dashboards

Data Service

* ADLS Gen 2 sits on top of blob
* Azure Data Factory is the orchestration tool
  * For transformation, HDInsight hooks into open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka
    * There is also databricks, which is fully managed and built off of Apache Spark
* Azure Synapse Analytics
  * Brings everything into a single workspace, but it uses the above components behind-the-scenes

AI Services

* Azure Machine Learning
  * Platform for predicting that uses your data, models, etc
* Azure Cognitive Services
  * Prebuilt models for vision, language, speech, etc
* Azure Bot Service

DevOps

* Azure Devops
  * Repos, boards, pipelines, artifacts, test plans
* Github
  * Repos, actions, projects

Costs

* Is it running? How many? Serverless? Storing data? Capacity? Transactions?
  * Deallocate, autoscale, tear down RGs
* Azure Advisor
* Azure Reservations
  * If you commit to microsoft for 1-2-3 years then you will get a discount for that resource
* Hybrid Use Benefit
  * e.g. SQL Licensing
* Azure Spot VMs
  * Microsoft doesn't want idle VMs just sitting around, but at the same time they need capacity for customers who want to provision a lot of resources all at once
  * You can use a Spot VM that has a % chance of evicting you if another customer needs the capacity, but it will be resumed after the fact
    * This could save you a lot of money
* Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator
  * Tell it what you spend today on-prem vs Azure

Azure Monitor

* AAD has sign-in logs, audit logs.. subscriptions have activity logs.. resources have metrics.. this all gets stored in Azure Monitor automatically&#x20;
* You can create alerts along with action rules that can call an action group, which might send an sms/email or make a call to a logic app

SLAs

* 99.9% availability means you can be down for up to 10 minutes per week
  * 99.95% would be 5 minutes
  * 99.99% would be 1 minute

Security

* Identity/Access
* Perimeter - protect against DDoS
* Network - NSGs, everything should be blacklisted by default and then you give permissions where necessary
* Data encryption
* SQL injection
* Azure Security Center is now called Microsoft Defender for Cloud
* Azure Sentinel sits on top of Azure Analytics workspace and use machine learning to detect anomalies&#x20;
