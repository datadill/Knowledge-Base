Capital Expenditure vs Operational Expenditure

* on-prem you pay for everything upfront, but in the cloud you pay for capacity based on what you use

IaaS = Full access to OS, but removes networking, compute, storage, etc

PaaS = Unlike IaaS, with PaaS you are only responsible for your app and data

SaaS = Everything is provided



Regions

* Each region (e.g. east-us, west-us) will have multiple physical buildings that are relatively close together
