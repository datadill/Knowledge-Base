Capital Expenditure vs Operational Expenditure

* on-prem you pay for everything upfront, but in the cloud you pay for capacity based on what you use

IaaS = Full access to OS, but removes networking, compute, storage, etc

PaaS = Unlike IaaS, with PaaS you are only responsible for your app and data

SaaS = Everything is provided



Regions

* Each region (e.g. east-us, west-us) will have multiple physical buildings that are relatively close together, but have separate cooling/networking/power/etc (Availability Zone)
  * For each subscription, you will have 3 availability zones, but if you have a second subscription then you might have 3 different availability zones (AKA 3 different buildings within the same region)
  * Zone redundant means that the service spans the availability zones. Some services are done automatically for you with a simple checkbox while other services have to be pinned to each individual zones manually (e.g. a VM has to be created and applied to each AZ manually)
* Close to customers, regulatory reasons, disaster recovery from natural disasters are all reasons for having multiple regions

Azure AD

* Cloud IDP (Identity Provider) contains users, groups, devices, applications, etc
* OIDC, SAML, WSFED, OAUTH2
* Authentication (OIDC, SAML, WSFED or **MFA** which involves any **2** of the previous) means proving who I am via something I know like a password/pin or something I have like a token/cellphone or something I am like a biometric
