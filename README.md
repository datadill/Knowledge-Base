### About Dylan Janszen

Born and raised in Ohio, I went to school at the University of Cincinnati where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information System and Marketing. Growing up I liked to play video games, which naturally led to me becoming an IT nerd obsesses with data. Currently, I work at a Fortune 500 company called Total Quality Logistics where I spend my days writing T-SQL/Powershell and tuning queries. After work, I like to boat and build custom FPV drones.
