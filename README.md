# Hello World

### Data Dill AKA Dylan Janszen

Born and raised in Ohio, I went to school at the University of Cincinnati where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information System and Marketing. Growing up I liked to play video games, which naturally led to me becoming an IT nerd obsesses with data. Currently, I work at a Fortune 500 company called Total Quality Logistics where I spend my days writing T-SQL/Powershell and tuning queries. After work, I like to boat and build custom FPV drones.



### What is this place?

For as long as I can remember I have struggled with notetaking. Growing up I would dread having to use pencil and paper to take notes while listening to the teacher. However, I was one of the lucky ones (sort of). During my first year of High School we were given ThinkPad laptops, which is crazy to think about because this was the same High School that my grandpa, dad, brothers, and uncles all attended. It just so happened that when IT nerd Dylan arrived they decided to adopt the laptop lifestyle. However, the problem I had with notetaking did not seem to go away. Yes it's true that I was able to organize notes better and type faster than I could ever write,&#x20;
