# Hello World

### Data Dill AKA Dylan Janszen

Born and raised in Ohio, I went to school at the University of Cincinnati where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Marketing. Growing up I liked to play video games, which naturally led to me becoming an IT nerd obsessed with data. Currently, I work at a Fortune 500 company called [<mark style="color:blue;">Total Quality Logistics</mark>](https://www.tql.com/) where I spend my days writing T-SQL/Powershell and tuning queries mostly. After work, I like to boat and build custom FPV drones... [<mark style="color:blue;">enjoy</mark>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYlauNckL3U)<mark style="color:blue;">!</mark>



### What is this place?

For as long as I can remember I have struggled with organizing my notes. I wanted everything to be organized, synced with the cloud, and indexed so that I could easily search for it at a moment's notice. I tried services such as Onenote, Google Docs, etc.. but none of them worked all that well. They were clunky, slow, and difficult to make updates to. A couple of months ago I stumbled upon a SaaS product that I was interested in and absolutely loved how they organized their documentation. It was elegant, easy to search, and looked professional; that is where I discovered [<mark style="color:blue;">Gitbook</mark>](https://www.gitbook.com/)<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark> This "Gitbook" (marked up Github repo) is a place where I can take publicly available notes and share them with the world.
